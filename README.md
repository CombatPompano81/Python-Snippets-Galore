# Python-Snippets-Galore
A huge amount of python snippets that you can use at any moment. Can be used to impress friends, or can be used for everyday work.

NOTE : Under the Apache License 2.0. Please contact my email (combatpompano@gmail.com) or my discord (pompano.#5388) in order to obtain these snippets of code for your use. Whenever you use these snippets of code, you must give credit (preferably a link to the github repo and my github username) in order to avoid plarigisim - related issues. 

These snippets are not intended for commercial use, and I do not recieve any benefit from making these small modules / scripts. They are simply intended for me to use to practice Python. Some snippets may be useful, some may not.

If you would like to contribute, please DM me on my discord (pompano.#5388) and I will get back to your request. If you have any questions, or would like to report an issue, please open a new issue and I will look into it.

Again, hope you like this complete package of files that you can use for everyday scenarios :)
